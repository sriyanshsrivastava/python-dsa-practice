# Python DSA Practice

This repository contains Python implementations of core **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It is meant as a personal learning project to strengthen problem-solving and coding skills in Python.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Arrays & Lists
- Sorting Algorithms
  - Bubble Sort (Optimized & Unoptimized)
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Searching Algorithms
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search (Including Infinite Array Search)
- Strings
- Recursion (coming soon)
- Stack, Queue, Linked List (planned)
- Custom utility methods (e.g., input/output formatting)

---

## 🧠 Learning Goals

- Build strong foundational understanding of DSA
- Practice clean and readable Python code
- Implement both naive and optimized versions of algorithms
- Get comfortable with edge cases and problem-solving strategies

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.10+
- Editor: VSCode / PyCharm / Any
- Version Control: Git & GitHub

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sriyanshsrivastava/python-dsa-practice.git
   cd python-dsa-practice
   ```

2. Run any script:
   ```bash
   python sorting/bubble_sort.py
   ```

## 🧩 Future Plans

- Add unit tests for all algorithms
- Expand to cover Graphs, Trees, Tries, etc.
- Add time & space complexity analysis per file
- Add Java version in parallel (for comparison)
